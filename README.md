# Instructions
You'll need NodeJS and Bower installed (bower.io).
Clone this repo then npm install and bower install.
Run the project with "node index.js"

You'll see a list of shopping items. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it is the following:

1. Add the ability to add new shopping items - this should be communicated to the server and not just done on the client.
2. Change the list of shopping items to be objects, rather than strings and add a "bought" property which can be set on-screen.
3. Add a new API endpoint to only return "bought" items and a toggle in the UI to show all/bought items.
4. Give it a bit os styling, you can use Bootstrap if you like.
